> Git is very powerful. 

Git is feature packed. But often in the software engineering field, we see many entry level software engineers not taking advantage of any of these powerful features. Many people are content with something like the following.

```sh
git checkout my-branch # at least they are on a feature branch!
git commit -am "stuff" # yuck!
git push
```

One special feature of git that is flexible enough to solve lots of problems while being easy to wrap your head around is [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History). Here is how you can rewrite history with interactive rebase to clean up a pull request. 

Let's assume the following scenario. You've just spent a few weeks cranking out a complicated feature on your favorite open source package. Now it's time to make a pull request! You're about to open up the PR, but you notice your `git log` looks a little something like this. 
```sh
parker:git-rebase parker$ git log

    now it works!

    fix dumb thing

    update dependencies
```

Gross. Let's squish all the commits together and rename it something meaningful so we can make a good impression on the package owner. This will leave their commit log in a much better state. 

In your terminal run `git rebase -i master`. Replace `master` with the name of the branch that is the target of your pull request. That should bring you to this screen in vim.

```sh
pick 08469b0 update dependencies
pick a8d4191 fix dumb thing
pick 2496ee8 nevermind
pick c59e651 now it works!

# Rebase 9b34c8f..c59e651 onto 9b34c8f (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Now, change each instance of `pick` (except the first), to `squash`. You can do this in vim by typing `:%s/pick/squash/g` followed by `ggciwpick` then save your changes and write the commit with `:wq`. This tells git to squash the commits with `squash` next to them into the previous commit. Next your should see this screen, given that there are no conflicts. 

```sh
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

update dependencies

# This is the commit message #2:

fix dumb thing

# This is the commit message #3:

nevermind

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 9b34c8f
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash a8d4191 fix dumb thing
#    squash 2496ee8 nevermind
# Next command to do (1 remaining command):
#    squash c59e651 now it works!
# You are currently rebasing branch 'fix/squash-bugs' on '9b34c8f'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   file
#
```

The next step is to simply change this file to the name of the single commit that will replace the first four. Something like: 

```sh
feat(package): update package for some reason
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 9b34c8f
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash a8d4191 fix dumb thing
#    squash 2496ee8 nevermind
# Next command to do (1 remaining command):
#    squash c59e651 now it works!
# You are currently rebasing branch 'fix/squash-bugs' on '9b34c8f'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   file
#
```

After committing, you should see a cleaned up `git log`. 

```sh
commit c81776ba0444931a8b6a5869ba7c294ad536e2cd (HEAD -> fix/squash-bugs)
Author: Parker  <email@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 11:27:33 2019 -0500

    feat(package): update package for some reason

commit 9b34c8f459f635f3fc95330cb90cda2bcf5cad29 (master)
Author: Parker  <email@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 11:13:29 2019 -0500

    initial commit
```

This looks way better! 

There's **so much more** that you can do with interactive rebase, including dropping commits, replaying them in real time to insert changes in between commits, and so much more. I would suggest trying it out the next time you make a pull request. Let me know if you discover any cool, out-of-the-box uses for interactive rebase!
