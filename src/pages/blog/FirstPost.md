If you haven't been on my site in a while, things look a little different. **I've completely migrated to a new site**.

My old site was running a Wordpress installation with a theme from Themeforest. I was paying way too much money for hosting on HostGator. The site was slow. I had to go through the less than stellar wp-admin interface to update my site, and there was a lot of bloat that didn't need to be there.

The foundation is done. Be on the lookout for a post explaining why I made the switch.
