Today, I had my first experience taking an Amtrak train. Having spent most of my travel time on airlines and in cars, this was a completely new experience for me, and I want to share what I learned so people new to Amtrak can know what to expect. I was looking at housing in the D.C. metro area for my upcoming move, and went to meet my family in New York City for vacation.

**TLDR - Take it. It was really cool and affordable.**

### Before the Trip

I got to Union Station in D.C. around 20 minutes before my train was set to leave, which was much more time than I needed. There is no security or check in process for Amtrak trains. Once you arrive at the station, you make your way to your train's gate, which will open for boarding around 10-15 minutes before the train's departure. Your pre-trip experience may vary, so get there around half an hour before if you don't know what you're doing.

### Baggage

Baggage on an Amtrak trip is very casual. I believe there is a system where you can check your bags, but most people, myself included, just roll on their suitcases and store them in the huge overhead bins. You are allowed two large carry-on suitcases that you would normally have to check on the airlines.

You can also bring anything you want on the train to eat or drink, including the bottle of wine and McNugget's that the group of guys at the table next to me shared to start off their weekend vacation.

### Trip Details

I took the Northeast Regional Train from Washington, DC (Union Station) to New York (Penn Station). The trip lasted about three and a half hours, and the train arrived in New York City one minute earlier than the schedule said we would. This is a nice change of pace from airlines that have a large window of variability in arrival times. If you want to shave off these extra stops and take the express train it will cost you a bit more, but the trip will only take three hours.

My train had around 10 - 15 stops on the length of my trip. Most people on the train were getting off at stops like New York, Baltimore, and Philly.

Ticketing on the train is somewhat confusing if you are expecting it to be like the airlines. The attendants don't check your ticket until the train is actually in motion, at which point they will walk through the cab and scan everyone's tickets. They do this several times throughout the trip, as people are getting on and off, but they only need to verify your ticket once.

### Amenities

My experience on the train was very relaxing and comfortable. I just went for the standard coach seats, but they were bigger than standard seats you would find in business class on an airline. However, I spent my trip at a table in the food car, which had lots of family sized tables surrounded by cushioned benches. This allowed me to spread out a little, have some snacks, and get some work done.

Speaking of snacks, there is a car that has a little snack and drink bar, that's a little overpriced, but not horrible. It's nice to be able to pick up a hot coffee or bag of chips if you need something.

The train has WiFi included for free, which was a very nice touch. It wasn't Google Fiber by any means, but it was enough to stream YouTube videos at medium quality, listen to Spotify, and browse the web.

There are also outlets that allowed me to charge my phone and laptop on the go - nice touch.

One thing that I am used to being without while traveling is cell service, and it was nice to be able to make calls and text people since the train is on the ground. I kept service (I have Verizon) throughout the whole trip.

### Cost

Amtrak offers a competitive price for the experience you get. I booked my one way ticket to New York 3 days before the trip for 93 dollars. There were no extra fees of any sort. If you book your train around a month in advance however, you can get a round trip ticket for around 100 dollars, this is a great deal for the experience you get.

### Conclusions

Riding on Amtrak was a really cool experience, especially since I hadn't done it before. For the D.C. to NYC trip, it is much easier than either flying or driving. I would recommend it to anyone.

Happy Traveling!
