Spotlight is a SaaS application that allows users to upload and share datasets while protecting sensitive customer information. This project involved architecting and building out the web application with React, Redux, and Typescript, as well as working with the client to define their needs and requirements.

The user interacts with the web application in many ways including drag and drop, text selection, and uploading and downloading files. I delivered elegant, accessible solutions to meet these UI requirements, while maintaining solid test coverage and code quality.

I took this application from `create-react-app` to production, where the web application is hosted as part of a larger Kubernetes cluster, allowing customers to utilize the application without having to send Spotlight their sensitive data. I also delivered utility components so future developers can easily add features while maintaining a cohesive user experience.
