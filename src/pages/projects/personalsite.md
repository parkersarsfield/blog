I built the website you are currently viewing from scratch. I used latest and greatest tech for building static sites to create a website that was fun to build and a joy to look at. The site has gone through many different iterations using lots of different tools. I switched from a WordPress site to a custom built React site. Read about the switch in a blog post [here](/blog/gatsby)!
