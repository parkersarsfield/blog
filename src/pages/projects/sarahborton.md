I made this project for my ~~girlfriend~~ wife(!) as a birthday present. I handled this project start to finish including design, development, and deployment. The biggest challenges in this project included designing the home page, adding mobile responsiveness without a library, and programmatically building out portfolio pages based on images in certain folders.
